## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Working with Grid, adding minor JS functionalities and switcher with Flexbox. It helped me understand Grid more, however there is still much to do.

### Continued development

I had issues with adding transition on flexbox switcher, so I need to find out how to do that. Also I am not sure if transition on body is a good way, to make theme changing smooth.
